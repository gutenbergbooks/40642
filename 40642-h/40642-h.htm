<h3>
<span>MECHANICAL ARRANGEMENTS OF BOOKS.</span>
</h3>


<p>All persons who, whatever might be their motive, have followed any
subject of literary research, must be aware of the extent to which their
labours are facilitated or retarded by the mechanical arrangements of
books, such as the goodness of paper, the legibility of type, the size
of volumes, the presence or absence of table of contents, indexes, and
other means of reference. It is in the possession of these conveniences
that the capabilities of typography, and its superiority over
manuscript, mainly consist. I propose now to set down a few remarks on
this subject, in the hope that any means, however trifling they may
seem, by which literary knowledge is rendered more commodious and
accessible, will not be deemed unworthy of attention by your readers.</p>

<p>With regard to the form of printed letters, it is difficult to conceive
any improvement in modern typography, as practised in Italy, France, and
England. This is equally true of Roman and Greek characters. The Greek
types introduced by Porson leave nothing to be desired. The Germans
still to a great extent retain the old black-letter type for native
works, which was universal over all the north of Europe in the early
period of printing, and is not a <i>national</i> type, as some persons seem
to imagine. These letters being imitated from the manuscript characters
of the fifteenth century, are essentially more indistinct than the Roman
type, and have for that reason been disused by the rest of Europe,
Holland and Denmark not excepted. In England this antiquated mode of
printing was long retained for law-books, and, till a comparatively
recent date, for the statutes. The Anglo-Saxon letters are in like
manner nothing but a barbarous imitation of old manuscript characters,
and have no real connexion with the Anglo-Saxon language. Their use
ought to be wholly abandoned (with the exception of those which are
wanting in modern English). Roman numerals, likewise, as being less
clear and concise than Arabic numerals, especially for large numbers,
ought to be discarded, except in cases where it is convenient to
distinguish the volume from the page, and the book from the chapter.
English lawyers, indeed, who in general have only occasion to cite the
volume and page, invariably make their quotations with Arabic figures,
by prefixing the number of the volume, and subjoining the number of the
page. Thus, if it were wished to refer to the 100th page of the second
volume of <i>Barnewall and Alderson's Reports</i>, they would write <i>2 B. &amp;
C. 100</i>. Roman numerals<a id="Page_50"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[50]</span> are still retained for the sections of the
statutes.</p>

<p>Akin to the retention of antiquated forms of letters is the retention of
antiquated orthography. Editors of works of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries sometimes retain the spelling of the period, of
which Evelyn's <i>Diary</i> is an example; but this practise is unpleasant to
the modern reader, and sometimes, particularly in proper names,
perplexes and misleads him. The modern editions of the classical writers
of that period, such as Shakspeare, Bacon, Milton, Clarendon, &amp;c., are
very properly reduced to the modern standard of orthography, as is done
by Italian editors with the works of Dante, Boccaccio, &amp;c. The attempt
to introduce the native orthography of foreign proper names naturalised
in English, is likewise unsuccessful, and merely offends the eye of the
reader, without giving any real information. Mr. Lane and other
Orientalists will never succeed in banishing such forms as <i>vizier</i>,
<i>caliph</i>, <i>cadi</i>, &amp;c., nor will even Mr. Grote's authority alter the
spelling of the well-known Greek names. Names of ancient persons and
places which are enshrined in the verses of Milton and other great
poets, cannot be altered.</p>

<p>The old unmeaning practice of printing every noun substantive with a
capital letter (still retained in German) has been abandoned by every
English printer, except the printer of parliamentary papers for the
House of Lords. Proper names used to be printed in italics; and
generally, the use of italics was much greater than at present. In
modern reprints, these ancient flowers of typography ought to be
removed. The convenient edition of Hobbes' <i>Works</i>, for which we are
indebted to Sir W. Molesworth, would be more agreeable to read if the
italics were less abundant.</p>

<p>The use of the folio and quarto size is now generally restricted to such
books as could scarcely be printed in octavo, as dictionaries and
similar books of reference. The parliamentary blue book, which long
resisted the progress of octave civilization, is now beginning to shrink
into a more manageable size. With regard to separate volumes, the most
convenient practice is to consider them as a mere printer's division,
which may vary in different editions; and to number them consecutively,
without reference to their contents. The Germans have a very
inconvenient practice of dividing a volume into parts, each of which is
a volume in the ordinary meaning of the word; so that a work consisting
of nine volumes, for example, may be divided into four volumes, one of
which consists of three parts, and the other three of two parts each.
The result is, that every reference must specify both the volume and the
part: thus, Band II. Abtheilung III. S. 108. Frequently, too, this mode
of numbering misleads the bookbinder, who (unless properly cautioned)
numbers the volumes in the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>Volumes, as I have remarked, are merely a printer's division. Every
literary composition ought, however, to have an organic division of its
own. The early Greeks seem indeed to have composed both their poems and
prose works as one continuous discourse. The rhapsodies of Homer and the
muses of Herodotus were subsequent divisions introduced by editors and
grammarians. But literary experience pointed out the commodiousness of
such breaks in a long work; and the books of the <i>Æneid</i> and of the
<i>History of Livy</i> were the divisions of the authors themselves. Since
the invention of printing, the books of the prose works of the classical
writers have been subdivided into chapters; while for the books of
poems, as well as for the dramas, the verses have been numbered. The
books of the Old and New Testament have likewise been portioned into
chapters, and into a late typographical division of verses.</p>

<p>In making a division of his work, an author ought to number its parts
consecutively, without reference to volumes. The novels of Walter Scott
are divided into chapters, the numbering of which is dependent on the
volume; so that it is impossible to quote them without referring to the
edition, or to find a reference to them in any other edition than that
cited. For the same reason, an author ought not to quote his own book in
the text by a reference to volumes.</p>

<p>The division most convenient for purposes of reference is that which
renders a quotation simple to note, and easy to verify. Divisions which
run through an entire work (such as the chapters of Gibbon's <i>History</i>)
are easy to quote, and the quotation can be easily verified when the
chapter is not long. The numbering of paragraphs in one series through
an entire work, as in the French codes, in Cobbett's writings, and in
the state papers of the Indian government, is the simplest and most
effectual division for purposes of reference. The Digest can now be
referred to by book, title, and paragraph; nevertheless the Germans
(who, notwithstanding their vast experience in the work of quoting, seem
to have a predilection for cumbrous and antiquated methods) still adhere
to the old circuitous mode of quotation, against which Gibbon long ago
raised his voice (<i>Decl. and Fall</i>, c. 44. n. 1.).</p>

<p>Some works have been divided by their authors into chapters, but the
chapters have been left unnumbered. Niebuhr's <i>Roman History</i> is in this
state.</p>

<p>The internal division of a work by its author is not, however, merely
for purposes of reference. It may likewise be a <i>logical</i> division; it
may follow the distribution of the subject, and assist the reader by
visibly separating its several parts. This process, however, may be
carried so far as to defeat its purpose (viz. perspicuity of
arrangement)<a id="Page_51"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[51]</span> by the intricacy of its divisions. Here again we must
recur for an example to the Germans, who sometimes make the compartments
of their writings as numerous as a series of Chinese boxes all fitted
into each other. First, there is the part, then the book, then the
chapter, then the section, then the article, and then the paragraph,
which is itself subdivided into paragraphs with Roman numerals and
Arabic numerals; and these again are further subdivided into paragraphs
with Roman letters, and Greek letters, and sometimes Hebrew letters. To
refer to a work divided in this manner by any other means than the
volume and page, is a labour of as hopeless intricacy as it is to follow
the logical cascade down its successive platforms.</p>

<p>It is a considerable convenience where the book or chapter is marked at
the head or margin of the page; and in histories, or historical memoirs,
chronological notation is very convenient.</p>

<p>In general no book (not being a book arranged in alphabetical order, as
a dictionary, encyclopedia, &amp;c.) ought to be printed without a <i>table of
contents</i>. The trouble to the author of making a table of contents is
very small, and the expense to the publisher in printing it is in
general imperceptible. Modern English books rarely sin in this respect;
foreign books, however, both French and German, are frequently wanting
in a table of contents. The invaluable collection of the fragments of
Greek historians lately published in Didot's Series&mdash;a work
indispensable to every critical student of ancient history&mdash;has no table
of contents, referring to the pages, prefixed to each volume. The <i>Poetæ
Scenici Græci</i> of Dindorf is without a table of contents; and a similar
want is a serious drawback to the use of the cheap and portable edition
of the Greek and Latin classics published by Tauchnitz at Leipsic.</p>

<p>Lastly, an <i>index</i> adds materially to the value of every work which
contains numerous and miscellaneous facts. The preparation of a good
index is a laborious and sometimes costly task; the printing of it,
moreover, adds to the price of the book. Many of the indexes to the
English law-books are models of this species of labour; the indexes in
the Parliamentary Reports are likewise prepared with great care and
intelligence. Even a meagre index, however, is better than no index at
all; and where the publisher's means, and the demand for the book, do
not admit of the preparation of a copious index of subjects, an
alphabetical list of names of persons and places would often be an
acceptable present to the reader of an historical or scientific work.</p>

<h3>
<span>CAXTON MEMORIAL.</span>
</h3>


<p>The inquiries addressed to me by
Mr. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> in your paper of the
15th of November appear to amount to this:&mdash;Whether the whole or part of
the expense of his proposed volume will be defrayed out of the fund
appropriated to the Caxton Memorial? To this question, so far as my own
information extends, I can only give a negative reply. The Society of
Arts, in compliance with a request preferred to them by the subscribers
at their last meeting, have accepted the charge of the Caxton Fund; and
it is sufficient, for my present purpose, to state that negociations are
now in progress between the Council and the Dean and Chapter, for
liberty to erect a suitable memorial within the precincts of Westminster
to the memory of William Caxton. This is as it should be; the memorial,
be it what it may, statue, obelisk or fountain, or even a niche in a
wall, should be substantial and enduring, calculated to remind the
passing stranger that within the precincts of Westminster, William
Caxton first exercised in England the art of printing. This circumstance
forms one of those epochs in the history of civilisation which deserve
public commemoration; and any memorial of Caxton should be placed as
near as possible to the scene of his literary labours.</p>

<p>Mr. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> says, that I seem to regard his project with somewhat
less of disfavour. Now I do not wish to be misunderstood. As a
substitute for the Caxton Memorial, originally proposed at the great
meeting over which the Earl of Carlisle presided, I am disposed to
reject it altogether, for reasons which I have already stated in your
columns. But as a literary undertaking I am willing to give it a fair
consideration upon its own merits. The apothegm that a man's best
monument consists in his own works, is capable of considerable
modification from the nature of the works themselves. In the case before
us, I believe the interest felt by the public in the works of Caxton to
be too limited to justify the republication of his collected works. The
proposal which Mr. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> makes for a selection from those works, with a
new life of the author, and a glossary, the latter proving how much they
are out of date, is much more feasible than his original plan. There is
a Caxton Society which has already issued several publications, and
whose usefulness would be materially increased by such a publication as
that suggested by Mr. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>, if the Society to which he alludes (the
Camden, I presume) should not be disposed to undertake it. The true
object of these and similar societies is the production of books of
interest and value, which are not sufficiently popular to justify a
bookseller, or an individual, in incurring the pecuniary risk of their
separate publication. Mr. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>'s literary memorial of Caxton appears
to me to come under this head, and as such might be properly undertaken
by any of the clubs or societies formed for the cultivation of early
English literature. He might<a id="Page_52"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[52]</span> perhaps more easily attain the object
of his wishes in this manner than by that which he has hitherto pursued.
When a selection is to be made from the works of any author, much will
depend upon the taste and discretion of the editor. Now I gather from
Mr. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>'s letter, that he is fully prepared to undertake that office
himself; and I may be permitted to add that his scrupulous accuracy and
unwearied diligence afford the best guarantee that the work will be
executed in such a manner as to fully satisfy the public interest in
Caxton, and to form a graceful and appropriate tribute to the
illustrious father of the English press.</p>

<h3>
<span>SETTLE'S FEMALE PRELATE, OR POPE JOAN; A TRAGEDY.</span>
</h3>


<p>I have not seen it anywhere noticed that this play, printed under
Elkanah Settle's name, with a long dedication by him to the Earl of
Shaftsbury, in 1680, 4to., was certainly a mere alteration of an old
play on the same subject. It is impossible for any one to read many
pages of it, without seeing everywhere traces of a much more powerful
hand than "poor Elkanah's," although he needed no assistance in managing
the ceremony of pope-burning. Take at random the following quotation,
which is much more like Middleton's or Decker's than the debased style
after the Restoration:</p>

     <p> Out with it, come; now wouldst thou tell me all,</p>
     <p> But art ashamed to own thyself a bawd:</p>
      <p>'Las, that might be thy father's fault, not thine.</p>
      <p>Perhaps some honest humble cottage bred thee,</p>
     <p> And thy ambitious parents, poorly proud,</p>
     <p> For a gay coat made thee a page at court,</p>

<p>In the <i>Biog. Dram.</i> (vol. iii. p. 237.), it is stated that the same
play, with the same title, was printed in 4to., 1689, except that it was
there said to be written by a person of quality. The play is, however,
claimed by Settle in his dedication to Lord Shaftsbury, prefixed to the
edition of 1680, now before me. I do not, however, believe he had more
to do with it than in adapting it, as he did <i>Philastes</i>, for
representation. The only question seems to be by whom the original play
was written? This I will not at present attempt to decide, though I
entertain a strong opinion on the subject, but will leave it to be
resolved by the critical acumen of your readers.</p>

<h3>
<span>HISTORICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.<br />
(<i>Eustache le Noble.</i>)</span>
</h3>

<p>Having been favoured by Mr. Gancia, of 73. King's Road, Brighton, with
an opportunity of examining the following work, I venture to send you a
notice of its contents, with some account of the author. Such books
have, I conceive, their utility to historians and historical readers. We
gain through them an accurate idea of party spirit, are brought into
more immediate communion with the opinions of the times to which they
refer, and can thus trace more closely the means by which parties
worked, were consolidated, and advanced their schemes. Even from their
personalities, we gain some gleams of truth. In this case, I am assured
that perfect copies of the work are <i>very scarce</i>. I cannot find that
any other copy has recently been offered for sale. This appeared to me
an additional reason for submitting a notice of it to your readers.<a id="Page_53"></a>

</div>

<p>Eustache le Noble, Baron of St. George and of Tenelière, the author of
this work, was born at Troyes in 1643, of a good and ancient family. His
natural abilities and attainments, combined with political influence,
readily obtained for him, at an early age, the post of Procureur-Général
to the Parliament at Metz. But a dissolute life soon brought on its
consequent evils&mdash;duties neglected and discreditable debts&mdash;and he was
compelled to sell his appointment. The proceeds were insufficient, and
he had recourse to forgery to satisfy his creditors. To be successful in
such a case, more than ability is required. Le Noble was suspected,
arrested, confined in the Châtelet, and condemned to nine years'
imprisonment. Upon his appeal, he was removed to the Conciergerie, a
place destined to become another scene in his life of uniform villainy.
Gabrielle Perreau, known under the name of "La Belle Epicière," was
confined here at the instigation of her husband, who indulged in the
hope of thus reforming her disorderly conduct. But a prison is hardly a
school of reformation, and La Belle Epicière and Le Noble were not
characters to receive, even in monastic seclusion, any such impression.
He won her affections, or the mastery over her passions: the husband,
frantic with jealous rage, obtained for himself the satisfaction of
immuring her in a convent of his own selection. From this she escaped,
and joined Le Noble, who had similarly<a id="Page_54"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[54]</span> evaded the vigilance of his
keepers. By living in the vilest and least frequented quarters of Paris,
by disguises, false names, and constant changes of residence, they
succeeded in baffling the pursuit of the police for three years, when Le
Noble was accidentally discovered; the judgment of the Châtelet was
confirmed, and he was reconducted to prison. It was then that his great
resources were displayed. He retained his gaiety, and assured his
friends he still enjoyed "une parfaite tranquillité d'esprit,
inséparable de l'innocence!" A man of this kind, with a venal and
capacious intellect, and a heart utterly unconscious of the slightest
moral feeling, could not with advantage be suffered to remain
unemployed. There was work to be done for James II., and the hireling
was worthy of his hire. It was simply to lie and libel with ability,
with caution, with the appearance of loyalty, and an ardent zeal for
religion. Le Noble was equal to the task. He had written histories burnt
by the hangman; Bayle had praised him for his skill in judicial
astrology; he had composed treatises on money, and on Catholic doctrine;
compiled historical romances, and translated the Psalms of David! In
poetry he had attempted to rival La Fontaine; written the Eulogy of the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and translated Persius,&mdash;substituting
French customs for the Roman, and praising, or censuring, his
contemporaries as though he were the Roman poet and not the Paris
scribe! An ability so various was at least well paid. He received from
the booksellers, and others by whom he was retained, a hundred pistoles
a month; Peignot states, in all, about one hundred thousand crowns.
There cannot be the least doubt this was but a portion of his earnings,
or that the work I have described was not written for the Jacobite
interest of James II. But no success in such characters is ever
accompanied with prudence. Although the penalty of banishment from
France was suspended, that his venal abilities might assist the designs
of others, he was always living between luxury and the direst want. As
he advanced in years, he was less useful, and was consequently driven
from doors where he had formerly been welcomed. D'Argenson allowed him a
louis-d'or for charity per week; but all other resources failed, until,
in his sixty-eighth year, after a long period of misery, and of the
uttermost mental and bodily degradation, he died on the 31st January,
1711, and was buried at the communal expense. It cannot be denied that
Le Noble united many pleasing qualities as a writer. He had read much,
could condense ably, and united to a strong memory a rare facility in
employing its resources. He touched with light ridicule the weaker
points of a case, and could wield both reason, sarcasm and polished
inuenda in misstating facts, or damaging the argument of his
adversaries. Such a man was well adapted to the French advisers of
James. Public attention was to be engaged and won by falsehoods in the
disguise of truth; bad designs were to be cloaked under moral purposes;
and the revolution was to be discredited in the name of loyalty and
religion. All this Le Noble did with infinite ability, and infinite
obliquity. I can give but a slight sketch of his work. The <i>Couronnement
de Guillemot</i> is a violent tirade against William. Marforio and Pasquin
converse about his coronation, and the king is described as one "qui
vouloit estre le bourreau du Prince de Galles." Churchill is "l'infame
comblé de tant de bienfaitz par son bon maître, et qui l'a vendu, trahi
et livré." In the decorations of the abbey, consisting of tapestry, &amp;c.,
there is stated to be a representation of Pilate placing Jesus Christ
and Barabbas before the people, and the choice of Barabbas by the
latter; James occupying, in Le Noble's opinion, the place of the former.
The people he describes as preferring even "ce voleur public, ce
scélérat, ce séditieux de Barabbas, ce meurtrier qui a poignardé les
<i>Withs</i> (Witts), à cet aimable maistre qui n'a jamais eu pour eux que de
la douceur et de la bonté." The <i>Sermon du grand Docteur Burnet</i> is very
clever, light, pungent, and satirical, especially against the king: the
text being "Dominus regnavit, exultet terræ, lætentur insulæ." In the
<i>L'Ombre de Monmouth</i>, William is described as wishing to be "le singe
du glorieux Cromwell;" Portland, Shrewsbury, Burnet, and Dykvelt, are
"ses quatre Evangélistes;" and the king is made to utter violent
complaints against the Parliament, which he calls "une étrange beste,"
and adds: "Si je n'avois pas cassé celui que j'ai rompu pour en
convoquer un autre, toutes mes affaires s'en alloient sens dessus
dessous." In the <i>Estrennes d'Esope</i>, which was burnt by order of the
States-General, there is the following description of England:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"L'Angleterre sous son Roi légitime et ne lui donnant qu'avec
   epargne comme elle faisoit le nécessaire pour son entretien,
   estoit justement comme ces sages et vertueuses femmes qui,
   fidèles à leurs époux, gouvernen avec un prudent économie leur
   ménage reglé, et cette mesme Angleterre, qui s'épuise pour
   satisfaire à l'avidité d'un tyran, est aujourd'hui comme une de
   ces infames debauchées qui, emportée de fureur pour une adultère
   qui l'enlève à son mari, lui fait une profusion criminelle de son
   bien."</p>

<p>In illustrations such as these, Le Noble was most happy, as with the
vice he was most familiar. The length of this paper precludes my sending
to you a pasquinade, in the epitaph written for Innocent XI., which,
considering its purport, is of value as indicating the opinions of the
Jacobites against the policy of the Pope. This I will do in another
paper.</p>

<h3>
<span>CALAMITIES OF AUTHORS.</span>
</h3>


<p>The miseries and disappointments of the literary life are proverbial:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Toil, envy, want, the patron and the gaol."</p>

</div>

<p>To these "calamities of authors," I wish to add a new, and as yet
unrecorded trial, incidental to this age of cheap postage and
extravagant puffs. I am myself <i>a small author</i>, and have written on
theology and antiquarianism; and my publisher's shelves know the weight
of my labours. Conceive then my delight, a few weeks ago, at receiving a
"confidential" letter from B. D., requesting the immediate transmission
of my theological tomes to a country address; on the representation
that, although B. D. well knew that my writings had been favourably
received, he judged that "striking recommendations at this moment in
influential journals to which he had reviewing access during the
parliamentary recess, would prove of essential service." I wrote to my
publisher, who coolly answered that it was "no go;" and I even stood the
tempting shock of a second application from B. D., remonstratively
hinting that, but for the non-arrival of the volumes, a notice would
have appeared that very week in an "important quarter." The hopeful mind
has difficulty in settling down into a belief that men deceive.</p>

<p>Not a month had elapsed before I received another letter, sealed with
such a signet as in size would rival the jewel sometimes seen pendent
from the waistcoat pocket of a Jew broker on Saturday, and engraven with
evidence of illustrious lineage, if quarterings be only half true. I did
not break this magnificent seal, but I tore open the envelope, and I
found that my antiquarian researches had been most flatteringly
estimated by a gentleman with a double surname, which happened to be
familiar to me. The communication was, of course, "private;" and it
expressed the writer's knowledge, from hearsay, of the "value, merit,
and ability" of my book, and the satisfaction it would afford my
correspondent, to give it a "handsome an elaborate review in both the
widely circulating and reviewing publications with which he had the
honour of being connected." A copy of my work was to be sent to his own
address, or to that of his bookseller: or, even a third course was
obligingly opened to me&mdash;"he would send his man-servant to my publisher
for the volume!" I sent the book, and the same day communicated with the
head of the family who legally bore this very handsome name used by my
correspondent, and he told me that he had just received 5<i>l.</i> worth of
books from a great house in "the Row," which were obviously designed to
be the response to an application from the gentleman with a large seal,
who was "an impostor." This may be so; but I have received an
acknowledgement for the receipt of my little work, so kind and courtly
in its tone, that I do not even yet quite despair of one day reading the
promised "handsome and elaborate review."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Fairies.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;An Irish servant of mine, a native of Galway, gave me the
following relations:&mdash;Her father was a blacksmith and for his many acts
of benevolence to benighted travellers became a great favourite with the
fairies, who paid him many visits. It was customary for the fairies to
visit his forge at night, after the family had retired to rest, and here
go to work in such right good earnest, as to complete, on all occasions,
the work which had been left overnight unfinished. The family were on
these occasions awoke from their slumber by the vigorous puffing of
bellows, and hammering on anvil, consequent upon these illustrious
habits of the fairies, and it was an invariable rule for the fairies to
replace all the tools they had used during the night; and, moreover, if
the smithy had been left in confusion the previous evening, the "good
people" always arranged it, swept the floor, and restored everything to
order before the morning. I never could glean from her any detailed
instances of the labour accomplished in this way, or indeed anything
which might aid in the formation of an estimate of the relative skill of
the fairies in manual labour; and I must confess that on these subjects
I never question too closely,&mdash;the reader will know why.</p>

<p>On one occasion, one of the family happening to be unwell, the father
went back to the smithy at midnight for some medicine which had been
left there on the shelf, and put the "good people" to flight, just as
they had begun their industrial orgies. To disturb the fairies is at any
time a perilous thing; and so it proved to him: for a fat pig died the
following day, little Tike had the measles, too, after, and no end of
misfortunes followed. In addition to this occult revenge, the inmates of
the house were kept awake for several<a id="Page_56"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[56]</span> nights by a noise similar to
that which would be produced by peas being pelted at the windows. The
statement was made with an earnestness of manner which betrayed a faith
without scruples.</p>

<h3>
<span>BURNING OF THE JESUITICAL BOOKS AT PARIS.</span>
</h3>


<p>The Quarterly Reviewer who endeavours in the number just published to
establish the claim of Thomas Lord Lyttelton to the authorship of
Junius, instances the following coincidence in support of his theory:&mdash;</p>

<p>   "Junius tells us directly, 'I remember seeing Busenbaum, Suarez,
   Molina, and a score of other Jesuitical books, burnt at Paris,
   for their sound casuistry by the hands of the common hangman.'
   <i>We may assume</i> that this took place in 1764, as it was in that
   year that Choiseul suppressed the Jesuits. Thomas Lyttelton was
   on the continent during the whole of 1764, and for part of that
   time resided at Paris."<a id="Paris1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Paris1" class="label">[1]</a> [The
 burning of the books referred to by B<span class="smcap lowercase">IFRONS</span> not Junius
(unless it be proved that J<span class="smcap lowercase">UNIUS</span> and
 B<span class="smcap lowercase">IFRONS</span> are one, which is not yet
universally admitted), took place on 7th August, 1761. See a very
curious note on the subject in Bohn's recently published edition of
<i>Junius</i>, vol. ii. pp. 175-6.&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">D.</span> "N. &amp; Q."]</p>

<p>But the orders of the parliament of Paris against the Jesuits, one of
which condemned some thirty of their books to be burnt, were issued
three years before the suppression of their order in France, viz., in
the early part and summer of 1761. That Thomas Lyttelton could then have
been in Paris is highly improbable; he was only seventeen, and it was a
time of war. Will any one take the trouble to ascertain where Francis
was? I believe he was appointed secretary to the Portuguese embassy in
1760, and returned to London in 1763.</p>

<h3>
<span>GRANTHAM ALTAR CASE.</span>
</h3>

<p>An old book now lies before me, intituled <i>England's Reformation from
the time of King Henry VIII. to the end of Oates's Plot, a Poem in four
Cantos, with large Marginal Notes according to the Original. By Thomas
Ward. London: Printed for W. B. and sold by Thomas Bickerton, in Little
Britain.</i> 1716.</p>

<p>In Canto IV., and beginning at p. 353., there is an account of a brawl
in the parish church of Grantham, anno 1627, arising, as appears by a
marginal note, out of circumstances connected with the "removal of the
Communion table from the upper part of the quire to the altar place." A
master alderman Wheatley, assisted by "an innkeeper fat as brawn," and
"a bow-legged tailor that was there," appears to have taken an active
part in the scuffle which ensued upon the vicar's persisting in his
determination. The alderman and his mob seem to have been triumphant on
this occasion, for we read, p. 356.:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p> "The alderman, by help of rabble,</p>
      <p>Brought from the wall communion table;</p>
      <p>Below the steps he plac'd it, where</p>
      <p> It stood before, in midst of quire."</p>

</div>

<p>A pamphlet war followed; for there was immediately <i>A Letter to the
Vicar of Grantham about setting his Table altarwise</i>. In answer to this
came <i>A Coal from the Altar</i>; which was in its turn assailed by <i>The
Quench Coal out</i>, and <i>The Holy Table, Name and Thing</i> (said to have
been written by Williams, Bishop of Lincoln.) A Dr. Pocklington (who was
he?) espoused the side of the Altar party, and published his <i>Altare
Christianum</i>. During this literary contest the vicar appears to have
died, and, some twelve months after his death, out comes <i>The Dead
Vicar's Plea</i>.</p>

<p>The affair seems to have created what we should<a id="Page_57"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[57]</span> now call a great
sensation in the "religious world:" for, says our author:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Scarce was a pen but what has try'd,</p>
      <p>And books flew out on every side,</p>
      <p>Till ev'ry fop set up for wit,</p>
      <p>And Laud, and Hall and Heylin writ,</p>
      <p>And so did White and Montague,</p>
      <p>And Shelford, Cousins, Watts, and Dow,</p>
      <p>Lawrence and Forbis, and a crew</p>
      <p>Whose names would"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Master Ward did not like these men, and therefore I omit his rather
uncharitable conclusion.</p>

<p>Is there any record left of the notable quarrel, which appears to have
engaged the attention and pens of some of the learned men of the age?
Perhaps some of your correspondents at Grantham could throw some light
upon this question.</p>

<p class="left"> Kirton-in-Lindsey.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   [This celebrated altar controversy occurred during the reign of
   Charles I., and its origin will be found in Clarendon's <i>History
   of the Rebellion</i>. The Puritans contended that the proper place
   for the table, when the eucharist was administered, was in the
   body of the church before the chancel door, and to be placed
   <i>tablewise</i>, and not <i>altarwise;</i> that is, that one of the <i>ends</i>
   of the table was to be placed towards the east, so that one of
   the larger sides might be to the north, the priest being directed
   to stand at the north side, and not at the north <i>end</i> of the
   table. The Church party, on the contrary, contended that as the
   Injunctions ordered that the table should stand where the altar
   used to stand, it should consequently be placed as the altar was.
   This matter was the source of much violent contention, and tracts
   were published neither remarkable for courtesy of language nor
   for accurate statements of facts. It appears to have originated
   in a dispute between Mr. Titly, the Vicar of Grantham, and his
   parishioners, respecting the proper place for the table. The
   vicar insisted that it ought to stand at the upper end of the
   chancel, against the east wall. Some of the parishioners
   contended that it should stand in the body of the church. The
   vicar removed it from that situation, and placed it in the
   chancel. The alderman of the borough and others replaced it in
   its former situation, when a formal complaint was made to the
   bishop (Williams). In 1627 the bishop published his judgment on
   the question, in <i>A Letter to the Vicar of Grantham</i>. The
   visitation of 1634 tempted Peter Heylyn to republish this
   <i>Letter</i>, together with an answer under the title of <i>A Coal from
   the Altar</i>, &amp;c. Williams replied in 1637 by a treatise entitled
   <i>The Holy Table, Name and Thing, more anciently and literally
   used under the New Testament than that of Altar</i>. Heylyn rejoined
   by his <i>Antidotum Lincolniense; or an Answer to a Book entitled
   "The Holy Altar, Name and Thing," &amp;c.</i> The bishop was preparing
   for his further vindication, when he was prevented by his
   troubles in the Star Chamber, in consequence of which his library
   was seized. "And how," says Hacket, "could he fight without his
   arms? or, how could the bell ring when they had stolen away the
   clapper?" During the controversy Dr. Pocklington, Chaplain in
   Ordinary to the King, published his <i>Altare Christianum; or, the
   Dead Vicar's Plea, wherein the Vicar of Grantham being dead yet
   speaketh, and pleadeth out of Antiquity against him that hath
   broken down his Altar</i>, 4to. 1637. The best historical notice of
   this controversy is given in Hacket's <i>Life of Archbishop
   Williams</i>, pt. ii. pp. 99-109., and was particularly referred to
   by the counsel on the Cambridge stone altar case, 1844-1845, as
   well as by Sir Herbert Jenner Fust in his judgment on it.]</p>




<h3>
<span>MEANING OF GROOM.</span>
</h3>


<p>In investigating the descent of two Devonshire families, I save met with
four instances of persons designating themselves as <i>groom</i>. They were
certainly well connected, and in fortune apparently much above the class
of people who accept the care of horses in this present day.</p>

<p>If they were grooms of horses, society was in a very different state
from that in which it is at the present day; if they were not such
grooms, what then were they? I believe they were unmarried persons.
First, there is Samuel Weeks, of South Tawton, groom; will proved in the
Archdeacon of Exeter's Court, 1639. His father was Richard Weeks, styled
gentleman in the parish register; and Samuel Weeks signs his name in a
peculiarly fine Italian hand, that I do not remember to have seen in any
instance of that time except in that of a thorough gentleman.</p>

<p>Francis Kingwell, of Crediton, groom. His will was proved in the
Bishop's Court in 1639; his sister married a Richard Hole, of South
Tawton, yeoman of substance; her second husband was John Weeks, of South
Tawton, gentleman, and his sons were gentlemen. These Weekses were, I
doubt not, nearly related to the Wykes or Weeks, of North Wyke, in the
same parish, a family of great antiquity.</p>

<p>Thirdly, here is John Hole, of South Tawton, groom, 1640. His inventory
is 180<i>l.</i>, of which 4<i>l.</i> was for his clothes, whereas a gentleman in
one case in this neighbourhood has his clothes valued at ten shillings;
Kingwell's inventory was the same.</p>

<p>Robert Hole, of Zeal Monachorum, groom, is the fourth instance. His will
was proved at Westminster in 1654; he was the son of a wealthy yeoman,
and his brother, Thomas Hole, was a gentleman.</p>

<p>I trouble you that I may learn, through your kindness, whether <i>groom</i>,
in these instances, was used with the meaning which we attach to it; or
at that time, or in the English language, or the vernacular tongue of
central Devonshire, meant anything else.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> I had also had my place at that   "We have a remarkable instance to this purpose in ecclesiastical
   history, which is attested by many and great authors. It seems,
   about 400 years after our Saviour's ascension, one Gregentius, a
   bishop, endeavoured the conversion of those Jews which lived in
   Arabia Felix. After a tedious disputation of three days'
   continuance some of the Jews desired the bishop to show them
   Jesus alive, and it would convince them. Immediately upon this
   the earth began to tremble, and the sky to shine and echo with
   lightnings and thunder. After these ceased, the gates of the
   celestial palace opened, and a bright serene cloud appeared,
   darting forth beams of an extraordinary lustre. At last our
   blessed Saviour showed himself walking on this bright cloud, and
   a voice was heard from this excellent glory saying, 'I am He who
   was crucified by your fathers.' This glorious appearance cast all
   the Jews prostrate on the ground, and, beating their breasts,
   they cried with a loud voice, 'Lord have mercy on us!' and
   afterwards were baptised into the faith of Christ."&mdash;<i>Sermons</i> by

the custom of serjeants-at-law presenting rings with mottoes, on taking
the coif, prevailed so long back as <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1670-80, and, if so, whether
there are any records, or other sources, from which he could ascertain

<span><i>The Duchess of Cleveland's Cow-pox.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Baron's <i>Life of Jenner</i>, Vol.
i. p. 123., there occurs the following note, extracted from one of Dr.
Jenner's note-books of 1799:</p>

<p>   "I know of no direct allusion to the disease in any ancient
   author, yet the following seems not very distantly to bear upon
   it. When the Duchess of Cleveland was taunted by her companions,
   Moll Davis (Lady Mary Davis) and others, that she might soon have
   to deplore the loss of that beauty which was then her boast, the
   small-pox at that time raging in London, she made a reply to this
   effect,&mdash;that she had no fear about the matter, for she had had a
   disorder which would prevent her from ever catching the
   small-pox. This was lately communicated by a gentleman in this
   county, but unfortunately he could not recollect from what author
   he gained his intelligence."</p>

<p>Can any reader of "N. &amp; Q." supply this missing authority for a fact
which is very important in the history of medicine&mdash;if true?</p>

<span><i>Heraldical MSS. of Sir Henry St. George Garter.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;What has become of
these valuable MSS.? and if the place of their deposit is known, can
access be obtained to them for literary purposes? They were, as Noble
relates, originally sold into the Egmont family, and descended to John
James, the third Earl; but some time after his death, about the year
1831, all the personal property of the family was disposed of; the
effects at Enmore Castle were sold by auction on the spot; and the
writer of this well remembers seeing the old family pictures preparing
for the same fate in a sales-room in Conduit Street, he thinks of Mr.
Abbots. Mr. Braithwaite, of Great Russell Street, was the auctioneer
employed at Enmore, and an inquiry was made of him at the time relative
to these MSS., and the answer was, that they also were destined to the
hammer. A catalogue also was promised whenever it should come out. The
writer was subsequently informed that the MSS. were withdrawn, and he
could never learn what became of them.</p>

<span><i>Bishop Coverdale's Bible.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;When did Bishop Coverdale <i>commence</i> his
translation of the Bible? Where was the first edition printed? Is any
copy in existence which possesses the <i>original</i> title-page, i.e. <i>not</i>
the one added in England, stating that it is translated from the "Douche
and Latyn?"</p>

<p class="right">      H. H. H. V.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   [We have submitted H. H. H. V.'s Query to our obliging

   rich in early English versions of the Bible, and who has kindly
   favoured us with the following  communication]:&mdash;</p>


<p>In reply to your correspondent H. H. H. V.'s very curious question to
know when Myles Coverdale <i>commenced</i> his translation, I beg to state
that he was born in 1488, and that it has not yet been discovered when
his mind was first led to contemplate the translation of the Sacred
Scriptures, nor whether he <i>commenced</i> with the New or the Old
Testament. The facts known are, that he finished the translation or the
printing of it on<a id="Page_60"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[60]</span> the 4th day of October, 1535,&mdash;probably at
Cologne, because other books printed there about that time have the same
initials, wood-cuts, and type. A copy, with the original title-page, is
in the Holkham library, having, on the reverse, part of the list of
books, showing that originally it was without a dedication; this has the
words, "Douche and Latyn." When the dedication was printed, this title
was cancelled and a new one printed, still with the words "Douche and
Latyn," with the reverse blank. A fine copy of this is in the possession
of Earl Jersey, and one with the title-page repaired is in the British
Museum. Perfect copies have a map of Palestine. In 1537, this book was
reprinted, both in folio and quarto, probably at Antwerp, and in these
the words "from the Douche and Latyn" were very properly omitted,
Coverdale being still living to see them through the press; these are
ornamented with large initial letters with a dance of death, and are the
rarest volumes in the English language. In these the dedication is
altered from Queen Anne to Queen Jane, as the wife of Henry VIII. They
were all dedicated to the king and to the queen; the two latter are all
in Old English type. These were followed by an edition dedicated to
Edward VI. in a Swiss type, 4to., printed at Zurich by Chr. Froschover,
and published under three titles&mdash;1st, as the translation of Thos.
Matthewe; 2nd, as the translation of Myles Coverdale, London, by Andrew
Hester, 1550; and 3rd, London, by Jugge, 1553. These are books of great
rarity, and may be all seen in my library by any of your readers,
sanctioned by a note from you or any minister of religion. My first
edition has several uncut leaves.</p>

<p>The introduction of the words "from the Douche (meaning Luther's German)
and Latyn" has never been accounted for; they probably were inserted by
the German printer to make the volume more popular, so as to interest
reformers by the German of Luther, and Romanists by the Vulgate Latin.
The translation is certainly from the Hebrew and Greek, compared with
Luther's and the Vulgate.</p>

<h3>
<span>MODERN NAMES OF PLACES.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 470.)</span>
</h3>



<p>Your correspondent L. H. J. T. has noticed the corruption of Greek
topographical names, arising from the use of the definite article, which
the ear of a traveller not skilled in the language supposes to be a part
of the name, and so makes <i>Statines</i> or <i>Satines</i> from Athens, <i>Stives</i>
from Thebes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to some readers of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" to know
that exactly the same thing has happened in Ireland, and that the
recognised Anglicised forms of several proper names, now stereotyped,
are a combination of the definite article <i>an</i>, of the Gaelic or Irish
language, with the name of the place.</p>

<p>For instance, <i>Nenagh</i> in the co. Tipperary is properly <i>Aonach</i> [pron.
<i>eenagh</i>], but generally spoken of by the people with the definite
article <i>an Aonach</i>, the Aonach, <i>i.e.</i> fair, place of a fair or
assembly; and hence by the English made <i>Nenagh</i>.</p>

<p>So also the river <i>Ainge</i> [pron. nearly as <i>Anny</i>] is usually called an
Ainge, <i>the</i> Ainge; and therefore is now <i>Nanny</i>, the Nanny, or Nanny
water, in the co. Meath.</p>

<p>In like manner, the island <i>Aondruim</i> in Loch Cuan, on which stood once
a celebrated monastery, is in Irish always called <i>an Aondruim</i>, the
Aondruim, and is now Nandrum or Nantrim Island.</p>

<p>The town of <i>Newry</i> is another instance. It has its name from an ancient
yew tree [in Irish <i>Iubhair</i>, pron. nearly as the word <i>your</i>] which
stood near it, and was said to have been planted by St. Patrick. Hence
the town is always called <i>an Iubhair</i>, the yew tree; which, by
incorporating the article, has been Anglicised <i>Newry</i>.</p>

<p>The river <i>Nore</i> in Ossory, is properly <i>an Eoir</i>, the Eoir [pron.
<i>Ore</i>].</p>

<p>So also the <i>Navan</i> fort near Armagh, is <i>an Eamhain</i>, the Eamhain
[pron. nearly as <i>Avan</i>].</p>

<p>I might fill a page with other instances, but I shall only mention
another similar corruption in proper names, where after dropping the
<i>Mac</i> the <i>c</i> is retained, in cases where the patronymic begins with a
vowel. Thus the descendants of the Danish family of <i>Ottar</i> became <i>Mac
Ottar</i>, and are now Cotter. So <i>Mac Etigan</i> became <i>Gettigan</i>; <i>Mac
Eeoghegan</i>, Geoghegan; the <i>c</i> being further transmuted into <i>g</i>. And
hundreds of similar instances could be given.</p>

<p>It may also be observed that the English very generally caught the
genitive, or oblique case, of the Irish proper names, and from it formed
the name which is now in use amongst the English speaking population.
Thus they heard the Irish speak of the isles <i>Araun</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the isles
<i>of Ara</i>, for <i>Araun</i> is the genitive; and hence they are now the <i>Aran
Isles</i>. So also the ford Trim or Druim, in Irish <i>Ath-Druim</i> (the ford
of the long low hill, <i>vadum Dorsi</i>), where <i>Druim</i> [pron. nearly
<i>Trim</i>] is the genitive of <i>Drom</i> or <i>Drum</i>, a long low hill, a back.</p>

<p>The names given to Ireland by medieval writers, after the ancient name
of Scotia had been transferred to <i>Alban</i> (which, by the way, is itself
a genitive, from <i>Alba</i>), afford instances of the same thing.</p>

<p>One of the native names of Ireland is <i>Eri</i>, or <i>Eire</i>, genitive
<i>Erinn</i>. From this the Greeks and Romans formed the name <i>Ierne</i>, from
the old word <i>I</i>, an island&mdash;<i>I-Erinn</i>, the island <i>of Eri</i>. And so we
now have also the genitive <i>Erin</i>, as a poetical name of the island. The
Danes, however, retained the absolute form, and called it <i>Eri-landt</i>,
Ireland.</p>

<p>So also from the old word <i>Ibh</i>, or <i>Hibh</i>, a tribe, or country, we have
<i>Hibh-Erinn</i>, the tribe, or people of Eri, and hence evidently
<i>Hibernia</i> and <i>Ivernia</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY.&mdash;PAROCHIAL LIBRARY AT MAIDSTONE.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 92.)</span>
</h3>


<p>As some of your readers may be aware, there is an old and somewhat
valuable library in the vestry of All Saints Church, Maidstone, which
was partly purchased by the parishioners of the executors of Dr. Bray
(who bequeathed his books to any parish which would advance fifty pounds
as a consideration for the value of them), and was afterwards increased
by the munificence of several benefactors.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1810, when the present catalogue was made, it would
appear that but little, or at any rate very insufficient, care was taken
of these books; for Mr. Finch, who rearranged the library and wrote the
catalogue, carefully correcting the inaccuracies in the former one,
declares,<a id="Page_62"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[62]</span> in a note that he has placed at the commencement, dated
October 1, 1810, that he "found many valuable books missing, and a still
larger number irretrievably damaged by the incursions of worms and
damp."</p>

<p>The number of volumes missing and decayed amounted to about 100, whilst
the number remaining in the library appears to have been 710, and their
gross value about 165<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Since 1810 far greater care seems to have been bestowed on them, for but
few, very few, volumes mentioned in the catalogue then made are missing,
and a daily fire during the winter months tends greatly to prevent their
further injury by damp.</p>

<p>I will not, however, trouble you with any further remarks about the
library itself, but proceed at once to the subject of my note, which is
to offer for your acceptance three proverbs (which I have met with in
reading one of the books) as an addition to the valuable collection
lately sent by your correspondent C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span>.</p>

<p>The book from which I have derived them is a small quarto, containing
the following tracts or treatises; but whether any or all of them are
now but rarely to be met with, I know not.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> 1st. "The Heresiography, or a description of the Hereticks and
   Sectaries of these latter times, by E. Pagitt. 5th edit. London,
   1654."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">2nd. "An apologie for our publick ministerie and infant baptism,
   by William Lyford, B.D. and Minister of the Gospel at Sherborn in
   Dorcetshire. London, 1653."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">3rd. "The Font guarded with XX arguments, containing a compendium
   of that great controversie of Infant Baptism, proving the
   lawfulness thereof; as being grounded on the word of God,
   agreeable to the Practice of all Reformed churches: together with
   the concurrent consent of a whole jury of judicious and pious
   divines. With a word to one Collier and another to Mr. Tombs, in
   the end of the Book. Birmingham, 1651."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">4th. "Vindiciæ, Pædo-Baptismi, or A Vindication of Infant Baptism
   in a Full Answer to Mr. Tombs his twelve arguments alleaged
   against it in his exercitation, and whatsoever is rational or
   material in his answer to Mr. Marshall's sermon. By John Geree,
   M.A. and Preacher of the Word sometime at Tewksbury, but now at
   St. Albanes. London, 1646."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">5th. [Title-page wanting, but it appears to have been this:] "The
   Gangrene of Heresie, or A catalogue of many of the Errours,
   Blasphemies, and Practices of the Sectaries of the time, with
   some observations upon them. By Thomas Edwards, 1650."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">6th. "The Patrimony of Christian Children, or A defence of
   Infants Baptisme prooved to be consonant to the Scriptures and
   will of God against the erroneous positions of the Anabaptists.
   By Robert Cleaver, with the joynt consent of Mr. John Dod.
   London, 1624."</p>


<p>These six treatises contain from 80 to 220 pages each, and in reading
them I have noted the three following "sententious truths," which I hope
may be thought worthy to be added to the much larger number contributed
by C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span>. The first is from the lines of Beriah Philophylax to his
friend Mr. Thomas Hall, which is prefixed to his "Font Guarded;" and the
other two from Edwards' "Gangrene of Heresie,"&mdash;</p>

<h3>
<span>"A BREATH CAN MAKE THEM AS A BREATH HAS MADE."<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 482.)</span>
</h3>


<p>With reference to the observations of H<span class="smcap lowercase">ENRY</span> H. B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN</span> upon a well-known
passage in Goldsmith's <i>Deserted Village</i>, a little consideration will
convince him that the view taken by D'Israeli and himself is not only
extremely superficial, but that the proposed emendation would entirely
destroy the poet's meaning.</p>

<p>The antithesis is not between flourishing and fading, but between the
difficult restoration of a bold peasantry and the easy reproduction of
princes and lords.</p>

<p>The first branch of the antithesis is between <i>wealth</i> and <i>men</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p> "Where wealth accumulates and men decay."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It then proceeds to set forth that it matters little whether nobles
flourish or fade, because a breath can make <i>them</i> as easily as it has
originally made them: but not so with a bold peasantry. When once <i>they</i>
are destroyed, <i>they</i> can never be replaced.</p>

<p>In fact, so far from the sense requiring the alteration of "makes" into
"<i>un</i>makes," the substitution, if we would preserve the author's
meaning, should be "remakes:"</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,</p>
    <p>  A breath <i>remakes them</i>, as a breath has made."</p>

</div>

<p>I only put this in illustration: Heaven forbid I should recommend it as
an improvement!</p>

<p>As for the cited "parallel passages," the best answer that can be given
to <i>them</i> is, that they cease to be parallel passages!</p>

<p>I shall therefore take the liberty to repeat a sentence from M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN</span>,
with a slight alteration:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "That Goldsmith wrote the line in question with the word

<span>BOGATZKY.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 478., 526.; Vol. iv., p. 44.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Perhaps the following Note may prove interesting, as a contribution to
the literary history of Bogatzky's popular work, and as explanatory of
the statement of R. D. H. (Vol. iii., p. 526.), that the book was almost
entirely re-written <i>by the Rev. H. Venn</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Golden Treasury</i> was introduced to English readers through the late
excellent John Thornton, Esq. This gentleman having met with a copy of
the German work, caused it to be translated into English. Of this
translation (in which many of Bogatzky's papers are exchanged for
extracts from English writers) a single copy was printed, interleaved,
and sent to the <i>Rev. John Berridge</i>, of Everton, for final revision.
This copy is now before me. The title runs thus: <i>A Golden Treasury for
the Children of God, whose Treasure is in Heaven; consisting of select
Texts of the Bible, with practical Observations in Prose and Verse, for
every Day in the Year. By C. H. v. Bogatzky: with some Alterations and
Improvements by various Hands. Also a Preface on the right Use of this
Book. Together with a few Forms of Prayer for private Use. "Where your
Treasure is, there will your Heart be also." Matt.</i> vi. 21. <i>London:
Printed in the Year</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCLXXV</span>. Then follows the Preface (pp. iii.-xvi.),
written by Mr. Thornton. The rest of the book extends to 374 pages of a
small oblong form. The whole is very copiously annotated by Mr.
Berridge, whose corrections are most important and judicious. He greatly
improved and simplified the language, his chief aim evidently being to
accommodate the book to the use of as large a number of readers as
possible. The humour of the man breaks out ever and anon in cutting
rebukes and sarcasms directed against unsound doctrine: neither
Calvinist nor Arminian, Pharisee nor Antinomian, escape his lash. A
considerable number of papers are either entirely re-written, or very
largely altered; <i>e.g.</i> Jan. 29 (by J. Thornton); Feb. 10, 19; April 8,
26; May 2, 3, 16, 20; June 19, 22; Sept. 9, 17, 18, 21, 25; Oct. 10;
Nov. 18; Dec. 1, &amp;c. About forty-three papers are left untouched, and
twenty others have only some verses added by Mr. Berridge. Next, as to
the extracts from English authors: in the interleaved copy the sources
are indicated in Mr. Thornton's handwriting for the first six months;
beyond which there is no indication of the kind. I subjoin a list of the
authors from whom extracts have been made:&mdash;</p>

28; <i>Mr. Bentley</i>, Jan. 1, 12, April 21; <i>Mr. Brewer</i>, April 15;

<h3>
<span>MORAVIAN HYMNS.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 502.)</span>
</h3>

<p>John Wesley was at one time of his life a pupil of the Moravians, and
Southey's <i>Life</i> of that remarkable man, like most of his works,
pregnant with interest and erudition, affords a satisfactory answer to
your correspondent's Query. I quote from the 3rd edition of the <i>Life</i>,
2 vols., 1846. Of the Moravians he says:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Madness never gave birth to combinations of more <i>monstrous and
   blasphemous obscenity</i> than they did in their fantastic
   allegories and spiritualizations. In such freaks of perverted
   fancy the abominations of the Phallus and the Lingam have
   unquestionably originated; and in some such abominations
   Moravianism might have ended, had it been instituted among the
   Mingrelian or Malabar Christians, where there was no antiseptic
   influence of surrounding circumstances to<a id="Page_64"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[64]</span> preserve it from
   putrescence. Fortunately for themselves, and for that part of the
   heathen world among whom they have laboured, and still are
   labouring with exemplary devotion, the Moravians were taught by
   their assailants to correct this perilous error in time."&mdash;Vol.
   i. p. 173.</p>

<p>He adds in a note:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The reader who may have perused Rimius's <i>Narrative of the Rise
   and Progress of the Herrnhuters</i>, and the 'Responsorial Letters
   of the Theological Faculty of Tübingen' annexed to it [the 2nd
   edition was published London, 1753], will not think this language
   too strong."</p>

<p>In the Appendix, p. 481., Southey further says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "The most characteristic parts of the Moravian hymns are <i>too
   shocking</i> to be inserted here: even in the humours and
   extravagances of the Spanish religious poets there is nothing
   which approaches to the monstrous perversion of religious feeling
   in these astonishing productions. The copy which I possess is of
   the third edition printed for James Hutton, 1746. An interesting
   account of James Hutton, who published the <i>Moravian Hymns</i>, may
   be seen in the great collection of <i>Literary Anecdotes</i> by Mr.
   Nichols, vol. iii. p. 435. Of their <i>silliness</i> I subjoin only
   such a specimen as may be read without  offence:&mdash;</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Quarter Waggoner</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 11.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;As the editor, in the exercise of
his official functions, may class this scrap with the <i>Replies</i>, it
cannot be amiss to state that I offer its contents as mere conjectures.</p>

<p>In the <i>Sea grammar</i> of captain John Smith, which was published in 1627,
we have a list of books adapted to the use of those who would <i>learn to
observe the altitude</i>, to <i>prick</i> their <i>card</i>, or <i>say</i> their
<i>compass</i>. It is as follows:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Master <i>Wrights</i> Errours of nauigation. Master <i>Tapps</i> Sea-mans
   kalender. The art of nauigation. The sea regiment. The sea-mans
   secret. <i>Waggoner</i>. Master <i>Gunters</i> workes. The sea-mans glasse
   for the scale. The new attracter for variation. Master <i>Wright</i>
   for vse of the globe. Master <i>Hewes</i> for the same."</p>

<p>It thus appears that <i>Waggoner</i> was either the title of a book, or the
name of an author; and we may infer, from the absence of particulars,
that it was quite familiar to the seamen of that period&mdash;as much so as
<i>Charles'-wain</i>. May it not indicate Lucas Jansz <i>Wagenaer</i> of
Enchuisen, author of the <i>Spieghel der zeevaerdt</i>, or mirror of
navigation, published at Leyden in 1585. The <i>Spieghel</i> became a
standard work; and a translation of it by Anthony Ashley was printed at
London, with a dedication to sir Christopher Hatton, about the year
1588. Mr. Joseph Ames, who gives the title<a id="Page_65"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[65]</span> of this translation,
observes: "Perhaps the sailors from this book call their sea charts
<i>Wagenars</i>." He was the son of a merchant-captain, and passed his life
as a ship chandler in Wapping: I need not search for a better witness.
With regard to the word <i>Quarter</i>, it seems to be an abbreviation of
quarter-deck; and if so, <i>Quarter Waggoner</i> would mean the quarter-deck
charts, or the charts which were supplied to the commander of a ship for
the use of himself and the other officers.</p>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> says that
none of Johnson's biographers appear to have known that the prospectus
which he has sent you was furnished by Dr. Johnson; but of this fact he
gives no other proof than his own opinion that "the internal evidence is
decisive." Now I really must say, that to my poor judgment nothing can
be less like Johnson's peculiar style; and, moreover, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span>, who
quotes Mr. Croker's note (p. 818., ed. 1848) on this subject, has
certainly not read that note accurately, for the object of that note was
to endeavour to account for Johnson's having frequently and positively
asserted that <i>Cibber had nothing to do with these lives</i>, of which
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> would have us suppose he wrote the prospectus for Cibber. If
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> will read more carefully the note referred to, which is
half Boswell's and half Croker's, and also another note (also referred
to), p. 504., he will see that it is impossible that Johnson could have
written this prospectus.</p>

<p>As I happen to be addressing M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span>, I take the liberty of asking
whether he has yet been able to lay his hands on Pope's Imitation of
Horace, <i>printed by Curll</i> in 1716 (see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. iv., pp. 122.
139.), and which he tells us he possesses. I wonder and should be sorry
that <i>such a curiosity</i> should be lost or even mislaid.</p>

<span><i>Dial Motto at Karlsbad</i> </span>

<p>&mdash;I do not think it
difficult to throw light upon the Karlsbad inscription sent to you by
H<span class="smcap lowercase">ERMES</span>. I believe that there is a mistake either by the inscriber or the
transcriber, and that the word CEdIt ought to be written CeDIt. The
chrono-grammatic letters or numerals would then
 be <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCVVVVIIIIIIIIII</span> =
<span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCXXX</span> = 1730. There are, however, as you have printed it, three other
capital letters, but I observe they are not in the same type as the
numerals. The question then arises, how do they appear in the original
inscription? do they all appear there, or only the first two. It is
possible that they, <i>i.e.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">H. H. T.</span>, may be the initials of the name of
the then owner of the house I should like this explanation better if the
only capitals, not numerals, were <span class="smcap lowercase">H. H.</span>, the initials of the first two
words of the inscription, and unmingled with the numerals. It would then
be <span class="smcap lowercase">H. H. MDCCXXX</span>, or as it would appear upon a house of the present day:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   H. H.</p>
    <p>  1730.</p>
</div>

<p>It is probable that by inquiry at Karlsbad, if it were worth while, the
name of the owner and date of the house might afford a certain solution
of his difficulty. The doubtful letters may be the initials of the maker
of the dial.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have to thank your

edition of Jeremy Taylor, in which the bishop cites a "common saying"
concerning Repentance. I had already discovered the error which F. A.
alludes to, my attention having been called to the words in question, by
finding them quoted by Jackson (Sermon on Luke, xiii. 6. <i>et seq.</i>); and
a MS. note in the margin by a former possessor of the volume gave me the
true account of the sentence.</p>

<p>I am living at a distance from libraries, and without the opportunity of
examining questions; but I believe F. A. will find that he has slightly
misunderstood L'Estrange; the sentence in question <i>not</i> being found in
Coverdale's translation of the Bible.</p>

<span><i>Rev. John Paget</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 133.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;Of this clergyman the following
mention is made in the <i>Resolutions of the States General</i>:</p>

   <p>"9 January, 1607. Op te requeste van John Paget, predikand van de
   Engelsche regimenten, is geordonneert de selve te stellen in
   handen van den Ovesten Horace Vere, Ridder, omme ordre te
   stellen, dat den suppl. van syn tractament mach worden betaelt."</p>

  <p> 9 January, 1607. Touching the request of John Paget, chaplain of
   the English regiments, is ordained that the same be placed in the
   hands of the Colonel Horace Vere, Knight, that provision may be
   made for the payment of the suppliant's salary.</p>

<p>From the register of a marriage celebrated at Leyden the 7th of January,
1649, between Mathys Paget, smith, and Maria Picters Del Tombe, both of
that city, it would appear that other members of the Paget family have
resided there.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Paget doubtless belonged to an English or Scotch family,
sometimes also called Pagett, or Pagetius. John Paget, who was the first
minister of the English church in Amsterdam, came there in 1607, and
preached his introductory sermon on the 5th of February, in the chapel
prepared for that purpose: his formal induction took place in the month
of April, in the same year, and here he remained twenty-nine years.
Thomas Paget, invited from Blackeley in England, was inducted in
November 1639, and departed the 29th of August 1646, for Shrewsbury.
Robert Paget, or Pagetius, minister of the Scotch congregation at
Dordrecht from 1638 to 1685, "was a man of extensive biblical knowledge,
but of extreme modesty." When the English church in Amsterdam was
offered him, he could not be prevailed upon to accept it. With Jacob
Borstius he lived on terms of close intimacy.</p>

<p>Consult the <i>Kerkelÿk Alphabeth</i> of Veeris, Wagenaar, <i>Beschrÿving van
Amsterdam</i>, and Balen <i>Beschrÿving van Dordt</i>; also <i>The History of the
Scottish Church at Rotterdam</i>, by the Rev. William Steven, M.A.,
Edinburgh and Rotterdam, 1832, and Schotel, <i>Kerkelÿk Dordrecht</i>, vol.
i. p. 457., and the note (2), vol. ii. p. 217., where many particulars
concerning the Pagets, especially Robert, are found. It is, however,
probable that C<span class="smcap lowercase">RANMORE</span> may obtain more information touching his family
in England than in this country. In Töcher's <i>Gelehrten Lexicon</i> mention
is made of Ephraim, Eusebius, and Wilhelmus Paget, all of whom resided
in England.</p>

<p>We also read in the <i>Lÿste van de Namen der Predikanten in de Provincie
van Utrecht</i>, by H. van Rhenen, 1705, p. 66., that Robert Paget, an
Englishman, and English preacher at Dordt, nephew of Thomas Paget, was
invited to Utrecht in 1655, but declined. He remained at Dordrecht, and
died there in 1684.</p>

<span><i>Lines on the Bible</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 473.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;"Within that awful volume
lies," &amp;c. These lines are Walter Scott's. They are spoken by the White
Lady of Avenel, in <i>The Monastery</i>. It appears that they were copied by
Lord Byron into his Bible, for they are inserted at the end of
Galignani's 1-vol. edition of Byron's Works (Paris, 1826), among the
"<i>attributed</i> pieces," as "lines found in Lord Byron's Bible." This I
believe is the only authority on which the compiler of the volume
referred to by your correspondent can have supposed his lordship to have
been the author. In Murray's editions they have no place, nor even in
Galignani's later editions.</p>

<span><i>Martial's Distribution of Hours</i></span>

</h4>

<p>&mdash;I ought
perhaps to thank T<span class="smcap lowercase">HEOPHYLACT</span> for good intention in answering, not the
question I did ask, but that which he thinks I "might have asked."</p>

<p>My real question was based upon an assumption, the truth of which
T<span class="smcap lowercase">HEOPHYLACT</span> denies: his reply therefore is rather a challenge to
premiss, than an answer to the question.<a id="Page_67"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>I totally dissent from him in understanding "quies lassis" in any sense
short of absolute <i>recumbent</i> repose: "finis," which he takes as the
real commencement of the siesta, I understand as its conclusion: nor am
I aware of any, except the last final quies, to which the term <i>finis</i>
would be applicable.</p>

<p>Neither can I admit, upon the authority of T<span class="smcap lowercase">HEOPHYLACT</span>, that there was
any gradual or partial cessation of business in Rome during the hour
which we call "between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon."
Julius Cæsar left home, commenced the business of the senate, was
surrounded by thronging applicants, and was assassinated&mdash;all during
that hour: and, unless T<span class="smcap lowercase">HEOPHYLACT</span> can show that therefore, and on that
account, it became distasteful to succeeding emperors, he must excuse me
from admitting his interpretation.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Roman Funeral Pile</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 381.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The ceremony of a Roman
funeral concluded with a feast, which was usually a supper given to the
friends and relatives of the deceased; and sometimes provisions were
distributed to the people. (Vid. Adams' <i>Roman Hist.</i>, 3rd edit. p.
283.) Basil Kennett, in his <i>Antiquities of Rome</i>, published 1776,
further observes (p. 361.) that&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The feasts, celebrated to the honour of the deceased, were
   either private or publick. The private feasts were termed
   <i>silicernia</i>, from <i>silex and c&oelig;na</i>, as if we should say
   <i>suppers made on a stone</i>. These were prepared both for the
   <i>dead</i> and the <i>living</i>. The repast designed for the dead
   consisting commonly of beans, lettuces, bread and eggs, or the
   like, was laid on the tomb for the ghosts to come out and eat, as
   they fancied they would; and what was left they burnt on the
   stone."</p>

<p>No authority is cited either by Adams or Kennett for the custom, but
your correspondent <i>John ap William ap John</i> might perhaps refer to
"<i>Petri Morestelli Pompa Feralis, sive justa Funebria Veterum</i>," with
some probability of success in finding the subject there treated at
large.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Barrister</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 472.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;The derivation of this word proposed
by W. Y. can only be looked upon as a joke, as he himself seems to
regard it. "Roister" can have no more to do with it than "oyster" has
with such words as "songster, spinster, maltster, punster, tapster,
webster," &amp;c., in which "ster" is the A.S. termination to denote one
whose business is "song, or spinning," &amp;c. Thus from the Mediæval Latin
"barra" we get "barraster, one whose business is at the bar;" this is
confirmed by the old mode of spelling the word, viz., "barrester and
barraster." See Spelman's <i>Glossary</i>, v. Cancellarius&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Dicuntur etiam <i>cancelli</i> septa curiarum quæ <i>barras</i> vocant;

<span><i>Vermin, Parish Payments of, &amp;c.</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 208.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There is no
doubt but that nearly all country parishes paid at one time for the
destruction<a id="Page_68"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[68]</span> of different kinds of vermin; but this practice is now
entirely discontinued. The following are the prices paid twenty-five
years ago by the parish of Corsham, Wilts:&mdash;</p>

<p>Vipers, 6<i>d.</i> each; slowworms or blindworms, 3<i>d.</i> each; rats, 1<i>d.</i>
each (the tails only were required to be brought); sparrows' heads,
6<i>d.</i> per dozen, (meaning the old birds); sparrows' eggs and young
birds, 4<i>d.</i> per dozen.</p>

<p>I shall never forget, when a boy, and my father was churchwarden, the
tricks the young lads and boys used to play in order to palm off other
birds' eggs and young birds for sparrows. One young rascal actually
painted the eggs very cleverly to imitate the sparrows, till I
discovered it. Young birds of all kinds were brought, and many dozens
paid for that were not sparrows; as it was impossible to tell the young
birds of many of the hard billed kinds from the sparrow. At last the
parish gave up paying for the eggs or young birds, but gave 1<i>s.</i> per
dozen for the heads of old sparrows, and vast numbers were brought
throughout the winter; and then attempts were made to substitute other
birds' heads, which were in many cases paid for. The next year the
parish agreed only to pay for the whole birds, so that no deception
could be practised. When the New Poor Law came into operation, all these
payments were stopped. Glead was a provincial term for the kite and
buzzard, the ringtail for the hen harrier hawk, and greashead or
greyhead for the female kestrel or greyheaded falcon. In most of the
Wiltshire parishes 6<i>d.</i> per head was paid for the hedgehog, as the
farmers always believed they sucked the teats of cows when laid down in
the fields. The badger was also paid for in some places.</p>

<span><i>Alterius Orbis Papa</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 497.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The origin of this title
is, I think, still open to explanation, and in offering one which I find
recorded in Lambard's <i>Perambulation of Kent</i>, 1596, pp. 80, 81. I trust
the quaint but interesting style of that learned antiquary and historian
will be a sufficient excuse to your readers for its insertion at length
<i>verbatim et literatim</i>:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The whole Province of this Bishopricke of Canterbury, was at the
   first divided by Theodorus (the seventh Bishop) into five
   Dioceses only: howbeit, in processe of time it grew to twentie
   and one, besides itselfe, leaving to Yorke (which by the first
   institution should have had as many as it) but Durham, Carleil,
   and Chester only. And whereas by the same ordinance of Gregorie,
   neither of these Archbishops ought to be inferiour to other, save
   onely in respect of the priority of their consecration, Lanfranc
   (thinking it good reason that he should make a conquest of the
   English clergie, since his maister, King William, had vanquished
   the whole nation), contended at Windsor with Thomas Norman
   (Archbishop of Yorke) for the primacie, and there (by judgement
   before Hugo, the Pope's Legate) recovered it from him: so that
   ever since the one is called <i>Totius Angliæ primas</i>, and the
   other <i>Angliæ primas</i>, without any further addition. Of which
   judgement, one (forsooth) hath yielded this great reason: that
   even as the Kentish people, by an auncient prerogative of
   manhood, do challenge the first front in each battel, from the
   Inhabitants of other countries; so the Archbishop of their Shyre,
   ought by good congruence to be preferred before the rest of the
   Bishops of the whole Realme. Moreover, whereas before time, the
   place of this Archbishop in the generall Councell was to sit next
   to the Bishop of Sainct Ruffines, Anselmus, the successor of this
   Lanfranc (for recompence of the good service that hee had done,
   in ruffling against Priests' wives, and resisting the King for
   the investiture of clerks) was by Pope Urbane endowed with this
   accession of honour, that he and his Successours should from
   thencefoorth have place in all generall councels, at the Pope's
   right foote, who then said withall. 'Includamus hunc in orbe

<p>There are also a few discrepancies in the amounts of the compositions,

that&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The Catalogue was printed five years before the miserable scene

<p>When we consider how many indications are still discoverable, by those
who know how to look for them, of the influence which the incursions of
the Danes and Northmen into Britain have exercised upon our language,
customs, and social and political condition; and that even the most
cursory glance at the map of these islands will show in so many local
names indisputable evidence of Danish occupation&mdash;evidence which is
amply confirmed by many of our archaisms or provincialisms, our popular
customs and observances,&mdash;when these things are considered, it is
obvious that a work which should give us the result of these incursions,
if written by a competent hand, must prove of great and general
interest. Just such a book has been issued by Mr. Murray, under the
title of <i>An Account of the Danes and Norwegians in England, Scotland,
and Ireland</i>, by J. J. A. Worsaae. All who had the pleasure of making
Mr. Worsaae's acquaintance when he visited this country in 1846-47, were
aware that he possessed two qualifications essentially necessary for the
proper execution of the task which he had undertaken. For his
archæological acquirements were made patent (even to those who were
unable to study his various antiquarian publications in Danish and
German) by the English version of his <i>Primæval Antiquities of Denmark</i>;
while his thorough mastery over our language was such as to enable him
to pursue his researches into the period of our country's history which
he proposed to illustrate, without the slightest let or hindrance. With
a theme, then, which may be considered as novel as it is interesting
(for it is the first attempt to view the subject <i>from the Danish
side</i>), and with such abilities to do it justice, it is no wonder that
Mr. Worsaae has produced a work which will, we are sure, be found to
possess the double merit of not only gratifying the antiquary, but also
of interesting, instructing, and amusing the general reader.</p>

<p>To form a complete Encyclopædia of Classical Antiquity, it was necessary
that to the <i>Dictionaries of Greek and Roman Antiquities</i>, and of <i>Greek
and Roman Biography and Mythology</i>, should be added a <i>Dictionary of
Greek and Roman Geography</i>. That want is in the course of being
supplied. The first Quarterly Part of such a <i>Dictionary</i>, called, for
the sake of uniformity, "<i>of Greek and Roman Geography</i>," but including
even Scriptural names, and so being in reality a <i>Dictionary of Ancient
Geography</i>, edited by Dr. Smith, written by the principal contributors
to the former works, and illustrated by numerous woodcuts, has just been
issued. It equals its predecessors in its claims to the support of all
students and lovers of classical learning; and we know no higher praise.</p>

<p>We learn from <i>The Athenæum</i> that Mr. George Stephens, the translator of
Tegner's beautiful epic <i>Frithiof's Saga</i>, and whose intimate
acquaintance with the early literature of Sweden has been shown by the
collection of legends of that country which he has edited in conjunction
with Hylten-Cavallius, and by the various works superintended by him for
the <i>Svenska Fornskrift-Sällskapet</i>, a sort of Stockholm Camden Society,
has removed to Copenhagen in consequence of his having been appointed
Professor of the English Language and Literature in the University
there. The subject of his first course of lectures&mdash;to be delivered in
the present month&mdash;is, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. After this we shall
be quite prepared to hear of a Danish translation of this masterpiece of
the Father of English Poetry, as a companion to the recently published
Swedish translations of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>B<span class="smcap lowercase">OOKS</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">ECEIVED</span>.&mdash;<i>The Rhymed Chronicle of Edward Manlove concerning the
Liberties and Customs of the Lead Mines within the Wapentake of
Wirksworth, Derbyshire</i>, &amp;c., edited by Thomas Tapping, Esq. This little
tract (which with its valuable Glossary, List of Cases, &amp;c., occupies
but forty pages) is an extremely curious book; and the manner in which
it has been edited reflects great credit upon Mr. Tapping.&mdash;<i>Neander's
General History of the Christian Religion and Church</i>, vol. vi., forms
the new volume of Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i>. The same indefatigable
publisher has issued, as the new volume of his Classical Library, <i>The
Odes of Pindar, literally translated into English Prose</i>, by Dawson W.
Turner, M.A.; and, as if this was not sufficient, he has added the
<i>Metrical Version by the late Abraham Moore</i>&mdash;a translation which he
pronounces, and with great justice, to be distinguished for "poetry,
scholarship, and taste."<a id="Page_70"></a>
